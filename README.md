# Sorting Visualizer by Chad Marshall
https://sorts.netlify.app/

## About The Project
Inspired by [Cl√©ment Mihailescu](https://github.com/clementmihailescu), I set out to create my own sorting algorithm
visualizer. My variation includes merge sort, quick sort with both Lomuto and Hoare's 
partition scheme, heap sort, bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, radix sort, shell sort, and merge sort.

## Built With
<table>
	<tr>
  <img height="50px" class="center-block" src="https://github.com/LordFreezer/Sorts-Visualizer_PUBLIC/blob/ASSETS/src/react.png">
  </tr>
  <tr>
  React
  </tr>
  </table>


## Usage
On the landing page, you can find a generate an array of random numbers between 10 and 600.

</p>

You can click on a sorting algorithm below to sort the bars on the screen. Below you can see a radix sort
in action.

Now the bars are sorted!

## Special Thanks
I would like to thank [Nikhil Sawant](https://github.com/NickSaw22) and [Kevin](https://github.com/Kevin6525) for their 
open-source variations of the project. I used both to debug animation problems in my heap sort and radix sort.
