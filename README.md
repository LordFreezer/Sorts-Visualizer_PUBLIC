# Sorting Visualizer by Chad Marshall
https://sorts.netlify.app/

## About The Project
Inspired by [Cl√©ment Mihailescu](https://github.com/clementmihailescu), I set out to create my own sorting algorithm
visualizer. Using his demo of merge sort, I extended the project to include quicksort with both Lomuto and Hoare's 
partition scheme, heap sort, bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, radix sort, shell sort, and merge sort.

## Built With

## Special Thanks
I would like to thank [Nikhil Sawant](https://github.com/NickSaw22) and [Kevin](https://github.com/Kevin6525) for their 
open-source variations of the project. I used them to debug animation problems in my heap sort and radix sort.
